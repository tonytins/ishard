# Ishard

Ishard is a [Boomer Shooter](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Boomer%20Shooter)-style game where you are super hero with technology-based ice powers.

## Influence

Inspired by [City of Heroes](https://archive.paragonwiki.com/wiki/Inf), influence is the currency earned by defeating enemies and completing said missions that is used to purchase upgrades. It provides a level of abstraction that opens up role-playing opportunities and the need for the story to justify the in-game elements.

In fact, the whole point of this game's story is that Ishard is trying to not anger the police department anymore than he already has. Meaning, influence grants you access to their resources in exchange for not pissing them off. It is an ideal currency for superhero games.
